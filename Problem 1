//PROBLEM 1: 1. An Internet service provider has 3 different subscription packages for its customers:
//Package A: For P995/mo 10 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P20/hr. Package B: For P1495/mo 20 hrs of access are provided.
//Additional hours are P10/hr. Package C: For P1995/mo of unlimited access is provided. 
//Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many hours were used.
//It should then display the total amount due.
